Letâ€™s make our first arrays!

Create 3 arrays as described below:

* A ```String``` array to hold the names of the following cities: Las Vegas, Minsk, and Sao Paulo

* An ```int``` array that holds the population of each city:
    * Las Vegas: 667,501
    * Minsk: 2,038,822
    * Sao Paulo: 12,330,000

* A ```double``` array that holds the average minimum amount of sunshine the city gets:
    * Las Vegas: 8.11 hrs/day
    * Minsk: 1.36 hrs/day
    * Sao Paulo: 6.05 hrs/day

Make sure you keep the array elements in the same order so that the same index can be used to get corresponding cities, population, and hours of sunshine. These are called parallel arrays.

Then print out the information for each city. Your output should look like the example below.

### OUTPUT:

```
Las Vegas's population is 667501.
Minsk's population is 2038822.
Sao Paulo's population is 12330000.

The least amount of sunshine Las Vegas gets is 8.11 hours a day.
The least amount of sunshine Minsk gets is 1.36 hours a day.
The least amount of sunshine Sao Paulo gets is 6.05 hours a day.
```
