The class Talker is a class that holds a piece of text. It has one instance variable, a String called speech that holds some text.

It has a few methods

outdoorVoice: Returns a String with the text in all uppercase letters (but does not change the instance variable!)
indoorVoice: Returns a String with the text in all lowercase letters (but does not change the instance variable!)
setSpeech: Updates the instance variable speech
toString: Returns a String representation of the object. This String should look like
"Text goes here," said the talker

To implement these methods, find a couple of methods in the Java Docs that will allow you to make a String all uppercase or all lowercase letters.

You can find the String documentation here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
