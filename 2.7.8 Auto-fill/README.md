For this exercise, you are going to implement the FormFill class. It has a few instance variables that store personal information that you often need to fill in various forms.

Read the method comments for more information.

As you implement these methods, notice that you have to store the result of concatenating multiple Strings or Strings and other primitive types. Concatenation produces a new String object and does not change any of the Strings being concatenated.

Pay close attention to where spaces should go in theString, too.


FormFillTester has already been filled out with some test code. Feel free to change the parameters to print your own made-up information. (Remember, we want to practice computer security safety. Posting your personal contact information is generally not advised, even if only the person sitting next to you can see it!)

When you run the program as written, it should output
