A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

In this program, ask the user to input some text and print out whether or not that text is a palindrome.

Create the Boolean method ```isPalindrome``` which determines if a String is a palindrome, which means it is the same forwards and backwards. It should return a boolean of whether or not it was a palindrome.

Create the method ```reverse``` which reverses a String and returns a new reversed String to be checked by ```isPalindrome```.

Both methods should have the signature shown in the starter code.

Sample output:
```
Type in your text: 
madam
Your word is a palindrome!
```
OR
```
Type in your text: 
hello
Not a palindrome :(
```
